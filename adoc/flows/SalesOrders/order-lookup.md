# Order Lookup Feature

The **Order Lookup** feature was introduced by HotWax to assist store managers at ADOC in retrieving detailed order information when customers inquire about their online orders while in-store. Previously, store associates faced challenges due to the lack of unified visibility of order details, often requiring them to contact the Customer Support Representative (CSR) to obtain the necessary information. This feature empowers store associates to respond efficiently to customer inquiries.


## Key Features

1. There is a dedicated section for order lookup in the Fulfillment App.
2. Allows sorting orders by date and filtering by brand, facility, order status, type, and sales channel.
3. Displays detailed information on the Order Details page, such as the facility where items are allocated for fulfillment, customer information, order identification details, and more.


## Additional Details Card

An **Additional Details Card** is available for each order, providing granular details such as:
- **Municipio**
- **Customer ID**
- **Invoicing Facility**: The facility responsible for invoicing the order.


## Handling COD Orders

For **Cash on Delivery (COD)** orders, ADOC requires visibility of the carrier responsible for shipping the order. This information is crucial as the store reconciles the amount to be collected from the carrier within **Retail Pro**.

- **Carrier Name**: Displayed in the Additional Details Card using labels like `COD-Drivin`.
- **Multi-Facility allocation**: If the order is allocated to multiple facilities, the carrier selected by the **Invoicing Facility** is displayed.
