# External Mappings

## Facility Blanket Customer ID

- Some Shopify POS orders lack customer details.  
- NetSuite requires every order to be associated with an existing customer.  
- Gorjana uses a **Blanket Customer ID** (named as 'Facility Blanket Customer' in the facilities app) for such orders.  
- Each facility must have its unique blanket customer ID mapped in both NetSuite and OMS to ensure smooth integration.  

## ShipSi Fulfillment Location

- Gorjana integrates with ShipSi, which assigns a unique **Fulfillment Location ID** (named as 'ShipSi Unique Code' in the facilities app) to each facility using its services.  
- This ID must be mapped in OMS to enable integration between OMS and ShipSiâ€™s Fulfillment App.  

## NetSuite Department Code

- Facilities are grouped into departments in NetSuite using specific **NetSuite Department codes**.  
- OMS must maintain these codes to post the appropriate department code for sales orders:  
  - **Online Orders:** Always mapped to the warehouse department code.  
  - **POS Orders:** Mapped based on the purchase location.
