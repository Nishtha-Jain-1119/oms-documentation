# Facility Setup Prior to Facility Opening  

Facilities can be set up in advance before their official launch. To prevent orders from being brokered to the facility before it opens, ensure the following configurations are turned off in the Facilities App:


## Sell Inventory Online  

1. Scroll to the **Sell Inventory Online** section.  
2. Turn off the **Online Facility Group** toggle.  

This prevents online orders from being brokered to the facility until the toggle is turned on.


## Fulfillment Settings  

1. Scroll to the **Fulfillment Settings** section.  
2. Turn off the **Allow Pickup** toggle.  

This ensures customers cannot select the facility for store pickup orders until the toggle is turned on.

<strong>Note:</strong> On the facility's launch date, remember to turn these settings on to enable online sales and fulfillment from the facility.
